# \[Generic Title]
This is a custom keyboard layout for the Sinhalese script that aims to be easy to use for anyone with a QWERTY keyboard. 
The main goals of this layout are,
- To provide an layout that would be easy to transition for anyone used to typing *Singlish* (*Not to be Confused with Singlish of Singapore*)
- To be trivial to figure out/use the layout with needing the Sinhala characters printed on keys
- ...and to give myself something as half as decent as [sl-sayura-m17n-db](https://github.com/mike-fabian/m17n-db-sayura) on windows

## Layout Details
- All aspirated consonats can be accessed by pressing `SHIFT` alongside the key corresponding to the non-aspirated consonant, except for four consonants
  - The exceptions are the aspirated versions of `ට, ත, ද, ඩ`. For those letters you instead have to hit `AltGr` (Ctrl+Alt) and the corresponding key to access the aspirated version. (Reasons why will be explained bellow)
  - **ALTERNATIVELY** You can access any aspirated consonant utilising dead keys, Entering `SHIFT+X` and any valid consonant afterwards will allow you to type the aspirated consonant
- Accessing pre-nasalised letters (sannyaka akuru, ardha-anu-nasikya akshara) depends on the letter, Refer to the above layout preview to see where to access each letter
  - **ALTERNATIVELY** You can access any pre-nasalised consonant with dead keys, Entering the `x` key and any valid consonant afterwards will allow you to access its pre-nasalised form
- Refer to the above layout preview for vowel letters, every vowel letter requires the `altGr` key to be held to be inputted
- Ligatures such as `ක්‍ය` (yanshaya) and `ක්‍ර` (rakaraanshaya) can be accessed with `SHIFT+Y` and `SHIFT+R` respectively
- Some keys are repeated in the layout for ease of use and/or preference, or perhaps to attain fake sense of consistency with some letters
