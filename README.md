# \[Generic Title]
This is a custom keyboard layout for the Sinhalese script that aims to be easy to use for anyone with a QWERTY keyboard. 
The main goals of this layout are,
- To provide an layout that would be easy to transition for anyone used to typing *Singlish* (*Not to be Confused with Singlish of Singapore*)
- To be trivial to figure out/use the layout with needing the Sinhala characters printed on keys
- ...and to give myself something as half as decent as [sl-sayura-m17n-db](https://github.com/mike-fabian/m17n-db-sayura) on windows
